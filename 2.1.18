this goes in the mongo db shell:

db.animals.find().sort({_id:1})

db.animals.find().sort({numlegs:1})

SORTING MONGO ^^

Routing:
router is what takes the event and maps it into some sort of action... so /index interprets as give me the first page there is no other path that I have here so I'll use THIS

router takes request based on your logic and its going to try to match...think of it as giant if statement because that is how it is implemented
